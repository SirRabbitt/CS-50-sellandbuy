# Sellandbuy

This is a project I have been working on alone for a long time, an advertising portal similar to OLX. Currently, I am working on its reconstruction after completing CS50, paying more attention to the more technical aspects of the work I am currently doing.

## Technologies

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Features

Login, registration, adding, removing, and editing advertisements, chat.

## Project Structure

Description of the project structure and main directories/files, along with their purpose. For example:

- `/client` - directory containing the front-end of the application, built with React.
- `/server` - Node.js/Express server directory that handles the application's API.
- `/models` - MongoDB database schema definitions used by the application.

## Running the Project

Step-by-step instructions on how to run the project locally. This usually includes steps like:

1. Cloning the repository.
2. Installing dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Running the development server.
4. (Optionally) Configuring the connection to the MongoDB database.

## Design Choices

The project is written very simply without Redux and MVC, which is its big drawback that I am working on.
